# High Seas
Arduino-controlled 3D game built using Unity and C#

## Where are all the files??
Because this was built in Unity, the many 3D assets and other large packages are too big for Github to handle. To access the rest of this project, download this [zip file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oq1SVA8LvO5C9pMb7tmW2tSQbdfP87qM/view?usp=sharing) on Google Drive. (It's not a virus, pinky promise)
